# text-to-html
E-text Site Generator

This project is a prototype for my pending book launch. I intend to share an electronic copy of the book through alternative methods other than a simple e-text. I will have the content eventually provided via a web interface hosted on my web page for readers to view a free and full edition of the novel Take a Trip. There are a few other projects I'm currently working on so please keep in mind the priority of completition will determine the launch date.

If you'd like a teaser of the reading experience, look at the project's web designs page of my website. The wireframes have been drawn up. The current user experience is a blander inital UI. https://crouther.github.io
